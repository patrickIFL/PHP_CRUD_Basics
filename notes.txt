will be as if you typed the code inside another code. (import)

learned Laragon, a better version of Xampp and can be used to simulate databases and local servers.
you can even create a dev version of wordpress.

learned the difference of $_POST and $_GET
$_POST = methods used to send data from a form
$_GET = get from the url

learned that you can use php to simulate react components.

encountered errors in localhost/phpmyadmin. thats because phpmyadmin is not installed. 
C:\laragon\etc\apps\ <- place it here when you downloaded it.

when laragon is running apache, mysql, etc, just C:\laragon\www\php_crud_training <- your folder name. 
it will run index.php inside it.

restart laragon if http://php_crud_training.test does not work.

if (isset($_POST['submit']))
a button with name=submit was pressed

$_POST is a method to get value from html to php by assigning a name.

PHP highlights 
C - $sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$age')";
R - fetchassoc gives an associative array
U - UPDATE users
    SET name='John Doe', email='john@example.com', age='25'
    WHERE id=3;
D - $sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id=$id";
